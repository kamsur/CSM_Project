# CSM_Project
 
This is a MATLAB project developed as part of undergraduate degree requirements, to calculate and visualize electric potential distribution and electric field distribution around a high voltage conductor, using Charge Simulation Method(CSM). The attached PPT and Word document describe the underlying theory, mathematical analysis and MATLAB programming technique used for the simulation.
