# Electric Field Calculation in High Voltage Systems using CSM method
 
This is a MATLAB project developed as part of undergraduate degree requirements, to calculate and visualize electric potential distribution and electric field distribution around a high voltage conductor, using Charge Simulation Method(CSM). The attached PPT and Word document describe the underlying theory, mathematical analysis and MATLAB programming technique used for the simulation.

# Electric Machine simulation in SimuLink

The SysDesign folder consists of a mini project to simulate a DC motor and visualize its performance characteristics
